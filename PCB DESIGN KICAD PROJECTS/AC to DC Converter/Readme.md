<h1>AC to DC Converter – KiCad PCB Design</h1>

This project implements the design of AC to DC power supply converter using KiCad.  
It converts 230V AC input into a regulated DC output using a bridge rectifier, filter capacitor, and voltage regulator.

<h2>Features</h2>
- 230V AC to regulated DC output
- Bridge rectifier based conversion
- Capacitor filtering for ripple reduction
- Compact 2-layer PCB layout
- Manufacturing-ready Gerber files included

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
- KiCad (Schematic & PCB Design)

<h2>Project Includes</h2>
- Schematic design
- PCB layout
- Gerber files
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- 3D board view images

This project helped me understand rectification, filtering, voltage regulation, and practical PCB layout considerations for power electronics.
